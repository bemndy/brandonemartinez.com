                        Hey üëãüèΩ I‚Äôm Brandon ‚Äî a Computer Science student at the University of Notre Dame from South Jersey. I‚Äôve built everything from front-end web designs to autonomous navigation systems,
                        and I‚Äôm especially drawn to spaces where code becomes an expression ‚Äî like robotics, audio signal processing, and graphic design.

                        I also love people. As a first-generation Hispanic 
                        student, I care deeply about the communities that helped raise me ‚Äî and I want to pass along the knowledge, 
                        support, and confidence I wish I had when starting out. I am involved with the Hammonton Health Coalition, 
                        ColorStack and HSF Foundation.
